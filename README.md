# Binary Search Tree Implementation

This 'The Odin Project' Ruby project provides an implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) with functionalities such as insertion, balancing, and tree traversal methods. It demonstrates the basic operations on a BST and how to manage its balanced state through various modifications.

## Files

- `node.rb`: Defines the `Node` class representing a node in the BST.
- `tree.rb`: Defines the `Tree` class which implements the BST with methods for insertion, traversal, and balancing the tree.
- `main.rb`: Main executable script demonstrating the functionalities of the `Tree` class using a sample set of data.

## Requirements

- Ruby (version 2.5 or later recommended).

## Setup and Execution

1. Ensure Ruby is installed on your system. You can download and install Ruby from [https://www.ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org).
2. Clone this repository or download the files into a local directory.
3. Run the script from the command line:

`ruby main.rb`

## Features

- **Creation of BST from an array**: The tree is initialized with a random array of numbers.
- **Tree Balancing Checks**: Checks if the tree is balanced and rebalances if necessary.
- **Traversal Operations**: Supports level-order, pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals.
- **Visualization**: Provides a visual representation of the tree's structure.
